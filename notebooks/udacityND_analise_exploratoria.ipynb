    "The Stomping Land raised 114,060 and provided some updates then completely vanished. Artists who worked on the game never got paid. The guy running the campaign ran off with all the money and then still had the balls to put the unfinished game up on Steam anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Xeko raised 257,870 and was meant to be a video game based on a previously released pokemon ripoff card/board game. There were a few sorry for the delay updates and then nothing. Then a post was made in the comments section saying that the person who ran the kickstarter actually didn't own the rights to the IP and was being sued by the creator of the original card game. Apparently it ended up costing 180k in legal fees, where the other 77k went isn't explained. The campaign creator dismissed this by claiming that there was only 40 legitimate backers and most of the money had come from friends and family so nobody had the right to complain. This was obviously bullshit since there was thousands of backers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaiju Combat raised 112,513 and claimed development was going well despite only ever being able to show one piece of artwork of one monster character. The excuse was one of the designers passed away (which is true) and then everyone else working on the game couldn't continue working without this one particular artist. That was it, they just never even tried to finish it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code hero raised 170,954 then gave regular updates with no progress and just continual excuses for delays. The campaign creator apparently hired 10 legit developers and promised to pay them 50k a year. 10 devs, 50k p/a, 170k budget, you do the math. One of the devs claimed all his paychecks bounced and the guy running the campaign asked everyone to work for free, which they didn't, then he just disappeared. Recently the same guy setup a website for the same game and is trying to sell pre-order copies but still hasn't responded to any of the kickstarter backers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greed Monger (lol) raised 90,132 and the guy running it was an entrepreneur who ran a long list of businesses, none of which were game development, and infamously appeared on a reality tv swingers show. He recruited some guy with serious mental health issues who he found on the Unity forums, although he didn't pay him anything. This guy then tried to put an MMORPG together using nothing but Unity store bought assets. The hired help got sick of working for free and quit working on the game then dumped a bunch of skype chat conversations to show what a dirtbag the campaign creator was. The creator then disappeared with all the money and the game was abandoned"
